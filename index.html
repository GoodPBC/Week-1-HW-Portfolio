		    I am an Enthusiast for life. We have one life to live(that I know of) on this fine planet of ours. I believe that the way to make it count is make sure that we are always striving to be the best possible versions of ourselves that we can possibly be. I have found that my path to fulfillment is by being a constant student of life...oh yeah and tech. The possibilities are infinite in the time we are living. I enjoy thinking about, studying and creating new applications of technology. There is so much to learn in such little time. Soak it up.

		   	In my previous life I traveled the United states helping small business owners everywhere solve their customer acquisition challenges.  Looking back it was one of the best things I could have done. My years of studying people and learning what they need, understanding their wants, has given me a strong sense of empathy to bring towards my development efforts. <br>
		   	I love to help so please reach out to me and lets solve a problem together. Two headsare better than one, yours is better than mine, mines different than yours. Lets put them together and do something awesome!
